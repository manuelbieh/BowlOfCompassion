		"There are several ways you can support our work in India. As an officially established non-profit organization we are able to hand out donation receipts that you can use for your tax declarations. To receive a donation receipt please let us know in advance so we can provide it on time. A Bowl of Compassion is run by volunteers who also have professional jobs. Sometimes it may take a few days before you receive your donation receipt. Thank you for your patience."
